### Tell me about yourself?
As you can see from my resume, I studied engineering and have been working in the tech industry for many years. I have a lot of experience with end-user support, server administration, and more recently building on-demand solutions that scale to meet the needs of a growing client list. 
I've written this FAQ to showcase an aptitude for forward-thinking solutions, and a desire to streamline repetative processes. 

---
### What is my work experience?
I have 9 years experience using PowerShell to accelerate my workflows, and produce business assets for internal and external consumption, including post-provisioning: software, configurations, mitigations, reporting, and quality assurance. This recent experience sits on top of over 10 years of end-user support, which yields a proven set of organizational, analytical, and problem-solving capabilities.

### What is a challenge I am seeking?
I like solving problems, specifically pattern recognition and optimization. Like a lot of automation-minded geeks, I tend to apply myself toward a more efficient state. 
Specifically, one thing I want to build is a tool that helps level 1 support diagnose common issues. 

---
### What do I like most about my current job?
What I enjoy most in my current role is problem solving, and working directly with other teams. 
After moving from field support to our RMM team, I wanted to be able to see support operations data from a higher level. I got to be creative for the first time in IT. 

---
### What do I like least about my current job?
There should be more training on company procedures, especially when changes happen.

---
### Why do I want to leave my current job?
I'm looking for a new, creative challenge to focus on, and I haven't been able to find one where I am.

---
### Why have I stayed at my current job for so long?
There were a lot of opportunities and I had different roles every couple of years. I aim to stay at my next company as long or longer. We survive because we adapt. Let's adapt together! ü§ù

---
### What type of company am I looking for?
One with a clear vision, and who reward teams, not just individuals. I prefer to be on a team and have a leader that respects my talents and shortcomings, assigns me appropriately, and who keeps challenging me.

### What is my at-work personality like?
I'm friendly and enjoy discussing the day's challenges with my colleagues. I tend to be a nose to the grindstone type of person, and I need a few different tasks to keep myself fresh and focused. I enjoy taking walks to clear my mind. 

---
### What is my biggest strength?
My ability to tune into someone's frustration, and to help them get to the root of it, regardless of their level of technical savvy. Also my vulnerability: I'm not afraid to say "I don't know" or ask for help. I've learned that asking for help builds trust and strengthens relationships. 

---
### What is my biggest weakness?
I tend to hold myself to a high standard, which can cause frustration because colleagues might find that level of satisfaction more quickly. What I found is that with some self-awareness and good communication, I can smooth that over, and it never really ends up being a problem. One trick that works well is to ask questions instead of giving critiques. 

---
### Am I willing to relocate for the right opportunity?
I would consider it proportionally to the number of boxes you check: 
<br>üíª I would need to start remotely, and be fully remote for up to 1 year. 
<br>üèñ My office would need to be no more than 2 hours from a coastline. 
<br>üë©‚Äçüè´ My residence should be 30 minutes from an elementary school. 
<br>üï£ I would also need to live within 30 minutes of the office (or an hour if remote 3 days a week).
