### Tell me about yourself?
I studied engineering and have been working in the tech industry for many years. I have experience with end-user support, server administration, platform adminstration, building customized middle-ware solutions, and web apps that expose them. More recently I modernized and deuplicated a monolithic codebase, transforming it into a modular, maintainable, and agile set of products that scale to meet the needs of several dynamic teams of professionals.
I've written this FAQ to showcase an aptitude for forward-thinking solutions, and a desire to streamline repetative processes.

### What is my work experience?
I have over a decade of experience using PowerShell to accelerate IT workflows. I produce business assets for internal and external consumption, including post-provisioning, software, configurations, mitigations, reporting, and quality assurance. This recent experience sits on top of another decade of end-user support on a help desk and in the field. The result is a proven set of organizational, analytical, and problem-solving capabilities, and a passion for distilling complexity.

---
### What do I like most about my current job?
What I enjoy most in my current role is problem solving, and working directly with other teams.
After moving from field support to our RMM team, I wanted to be able to see support operations data from a higher level. I got to be creative for the first time in IT.

---
### What do I like least about my current job?
Lack of upward mobility.

---
### Why do I want to leave my current job?
The group I work through was not awarded another contract to staff our team.

---
### What is a challenge I am seeking?
I like solving problems, specifically pattern recognition and optimization. Like a lot of automation-minded geeks, I tend to apply myself toward a more efficient state. 

---
### Why have I stayed at my current job for so long?
There were a lot of opportunities and I had different roles every couple of years. I aim to stay at my next company as long or longer. We survive because we adapt. Let's adapt together!

---
### What type of company am I looking for?
One with a clear vision, and who reward teams, not just individuals. I prefer to be on a team and have a leader that respects my talents and shortcomings, assigns me appropriately, and who keeps challenging me.

### What is my at-work personality like?
I'm friendly and enjoy discussing the day's challenges with my colleagues. I tend to be a nose to the grindstone type of person, and I need a few different tasks to keep myself fresh and focused. I enjoy taking walks to clear my mind. 

---
### What is my biggest strength?
My ability to tune into someone's frustration, and to help them get to the root of it, regardless of their level of technical savvy. Also my vulnerability: I'm not afraid to say "I don't know" or ask for help. I've learned that asking for help builds trust and strengthens relationships. 

---
### What is my biggest weakness?
I tend to hold myself to a high standard, which can cause frustration because colleagues might find that level of satisfaction more quickly. What I found is that with some self-awareness and good communication, I can smooth that over, and it never really ends up being a problem. One method that works well is to ask questions instead of giving critiques. 

---
### Am I willing to relocate for the right opportunity?
Yes. 

---
### What about remote work versus RTO?
I enjoy the flexibility of remote work. Though ideally I would be in the office 50% of the time, a lot of my work requires deep focus and distractions are productivity killers. I've worked remotely full-time for more than 2 years but I would prefer to not be. To me, the deal breaker is being forced to work in an office but every meeting is still hosted on Zoom. It's all about context, and also the nature of the work.
