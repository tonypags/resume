### What is my work experience? 
I have 6 years experience using PowerShell to accelerate my workflows, and produce business assets for internal and external consumption, including post-provisioning: software, configurations, mitigations, reporting, and quality assurance. I can design and build environments, but not as quickly as someone who does that every day. Until I start doing it every day, then Watch OUT‚ùóÔ∏è


### What is a challenge I am seeking?
I like solving problems, specifically pattern recognition and optimization. 
I'm not lazy. I tend to apply myself toward a more efficient state. 


### What do I like most about my current job?
What I enjoy most in my current role is problem solving, and working directly with other teams. 
After moving from field support to our RMM team, I wanted to be able to see support operations data from a higher level. I got to be creative for the first time in IT. I caught the bug, as they say. 


### What do I like least about my current job?
There is not enough training on company procedures, but plenty of training on policies. 


### Why do I want to leave my current job?
I'm looking for a creative challenge and I haven't been able to find one where I am.


### Why have I stayed at my current job for so long?
There were a lot of opportunities and I was on two different teams. I aim to stay at my next company as long or longer. We survive because we adapt. Let's adapt together! ü§ù


### What is my at-work personality like?
I'm friendly and enjoy discussing the day's challenges with my colleagues. I tend to be a nose to the grindstone type of person, and I need a few different tasks to keep myself fresh and focused (not 50! Some folks out there are bonkers). I enjoy taking walks to clear my mind. 


### What type of role am I looking for?
- Post-provisioning server and desktop environments using PowerShell, Azure, and 365. I can learn other tools in a relatively short timeframe. 
- Creating tools for use in data consumption, post-provisioning, and quality assurance. 
- Writing logic for business processes. 

I prefer to be on a team and have a leader that respects my talents and shortcomings, assigns me appropriately, and who keeps challenging me. 


### What type of company am I looking for?
One with a clear vision and who reward teams, not just individuals. 


### What is my biggest strength?
My attention to detail. Also my vulnerability. Those who get to know me know I'm not afraid to say "I don't know" or ask for help. I've learned that asking for help builds trust and strengthens relationships. 


### What is my biggest weakness?
I have a big weakness for puzzles. I lose all track of time trying to solve them. Sometimes I forget to eat. 


#### Come on, really?
Okay you got me. The biggest area of improvement in my life right now is precision of (spoken) language. 


### Is there anything about the industry I'm curious about?
I wonder what people will complain about once we solve all the current problems computers tend to have. I bet turning it on and off again will always be a thing.
