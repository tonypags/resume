# FAQ

### What is my work experience? 
I have 6 years experience using PowerShell to accelerate my workflows, and produce business assets for internal and external consumption, including post-provisioning: software, configurations, mitigations, reporting, and quality assurance. I can design and build environments, but not as quickly as someone who does that every day. Until I start doing it every day, then Watch OUT‚ùóÔ∏è


### What is a challenge I am seeking?
I like solving problems, specifically pattern recognition and optimization. 
I'm not lazy. I tend to apply myself toward a more efficient state. 


### What do I like most about my current job?
What I enjoyed most in my last role was problem solving, working directly with other teams. 
After moving from field support to our RMM team, I wanted to be able to see support operations data from a higher level. I got to be creative for the first time in IT. I caught the bug, as they say. 


### What do I like least about my current job?
There is not enough training on company procedures. But plenty of training on policies. 


### Why do I want to leave my job?
I'm looking for a creative challenge and I haven't been able to find one where I am.


### Why did I stay there for so long?
There were a lot of opportunities and I was on 2 different teams. I aim to stay at my next company as long or longer. We survive because we adapt. Let's adapt together! ü§ù


### What is my at-work personality like?
I'm friendly and enjoy discussing the day's challenges with my colleagues. I tend to be a nose to the grindstone type of person, and I need a few different tasks to keep myself fresh and focused (not 50! Some of you out there are bonkers). I enjoy taking walks to clear my mind. I think I'm the only person who doesn't like comic books in IT. 


### What type of role am I looking for?
- Post-provisioning server and desktop environments using PowerShell, Azure, and 365. No issues learning other tools. 
- Creating tools for use in data consumption, post-provisioning, and quality assurance. 
- Writing logic for business processes. 

I need to be on a team and have a leader that respects my talents and shortcomings, assigns me appropriately, and who keeps challenging me. 


### What type of company am I looking for?
One with a clear vision and who reward teams, not just individuals. 


### What is my biggest strength?
My attention to detail. The tendancy is a bit much sometimes. No one likes to be corrected all the time. I have to bite my tongue a lot. 

Also my vulnerability. Those who get to know me know I'm not afraid to say "I don't know" or ask for help. It goes both ways, you know. 


### What is my biggest weakness?
I have a big weakness for puzzles. I lose all track of time trying to solve them. Sometimes I forget to eat. 


### Come on, really?
Okay you got me. The biggest area of improvement in my life right now is precision of (spoken) language. 


### Is there anything about the industry I'm curious about?
I wonder what people will complain about once we solve all the current problems computers tend to have. I bet turning it on and off again will always be a thing.
