### Tell me about yourself?
As you can see from my resume, I studied engineering and have been working in the tech industry for many years. I have a lot of experience with end-user support, server administration, and more recently building on-demand solutions that scale to meet the needs of a growing client list. 
I've written this FAQ to showcase an aptitude for forward-thinking, and a desire to streamline repetative processes. 


### What is my work experience?
I have 6 years experience using PowerShell to accelerate my workflows, and produce business assets for internal and external consumption, including post-provisioning: software, configurations, mitigations, reporting, and quality assurance. This recent experience sits on top of over 10 years of end-user support, the sum of which yields 


### What is a challenge I am seeking?
I like solving problems, specifically pattern recognition and optimization. Like a lot of automation-minded geeks, I tend to apply myself toward a more efficient state. I want to build a tool that helps level 1 support diagnose common issues. 


### What do I like most about my current job?
What I enjoy most in my current role is problem solving, and working directly with other teams. 
After moving from field support to our RMM team, I wanted to be able to see support operations data from a higher level. I got to be creative for the first time in IT. I caught the bug, as they say. 


### What do I like least about my current job?
There is not enough training on company procedures, especially when changes happen.


### Why do I want to leave my current job?
I'm looking for a new, creative challenge and I haven't been able to find one where I am.


### Why have I stayed at my current job for so long?
There were a lot of opportunities and I was on two different teams. I aim to stay at my next company as long or longer. We survive because we adapt. Let's adapt together! ü§ù


### What is my at-work personality like?
I'm friendly and enjoy discussing the day's challenges with my colleagues. I tend to be a nose to the grindstone type of person, and I need a few different tasks to keep myself fresh and focused. I enjoy taking walks to clear my mind. 


### What type of role am I looking for?
I prefer to be on a team and have a leader that respects my talents and shortcomings, assigns me appropriately, and who keeps challenging me. Some values I would contribute are:
- Post-provisioning server and desktop environments using PowerShell, Azure, and 365. I can learn other tools in a relatively short timeframe. 
- Resolving escalations pertaining to complex or systemic issues, finding root causes. 
- Creating tools for use in data consumption, post-provisioning, and quality assurance. 
- Writing logic for business processes. 


### What type of company am I looking for?
One with a clear vision, and who reward teams, not just individuals. 


### What is my biggest strength?
My attention to detail. Also my vulnerability: those who get to know me know I'm not afraid to say "I don't know" or ask for help. I've learned that asking for help builds trust and strengthens relationships. 


### What is my biggest weakness?
I tend to hold myself to a high standard and sometimes this can cause frustration because not everyone does that. What I found is that with some self-awareness and good communication, I can smooth that over, and it never really ends up being a problem.
